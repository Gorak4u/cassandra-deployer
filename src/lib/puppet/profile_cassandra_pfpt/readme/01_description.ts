## Description

This module provides a complete profile for deploying and managing an Apache Cassandra node. It acts as a wrapper around the \`cassandra_pfpt\` component module, providing all of its configuration data via Hiera lookups. This allows for a clean separation of logic (in the component module) from data (in Hiera).
